# Professional Development Assignments

## Week 1

### <u>Quantative Accomplishments</u>
  + While working for a local stainless steel fabrication shop, I suggested the owner use a different supplier
  when it came to welding supplies.
  
      + This ultimately lead to thousands of dollars in savings yearly.
      
  + While working for a local filtration company, I found that their eCommerce platform could be updated to 
  add new information as well as improve search engine optimization (SEO).
      
      + The resulting sales from my changes nearly doubled their revenue from their online store.
      
  + During the summer that I was an intern at the permitting office for the City of Albuquerque,
  I implemented a simple sign in station that helped establish a first come first serve basis.
  
      + Before the sign in station, I found that a lot of contractors that frequented the office would 
      cut in front of other customers, causing some customers to be there much longer than was necessary.
      
### <u>Qualitative Features</u>
  
  + When working on a project that has multiples of the same part being made, I tend to create jigs to help 
  expedite the process.
  
      + I found that this not only helped speed up production, but it also lead to less frequent errors. 
      
  + I go out of my way to make sure that if I am part of a group, my team and I succeed as a whole.
  
      + I have found myself a few times in a position where success would be easily obtainable individually
      but have chosen to stay behind to help others that needed it.
      
  + When others don't feel comfortable in a certain situation and have distanced themselves I try 
  to make them feel more welcome.
  
      + As someone who has had social anxiety I try very hard to help people overcome 
      that fear.
      
  
  
### <u>How I Develop My Brain</u>

    A few of the ways I try to develop my brain are attention to detail, technical knowledge, and
    listening. Attention to detail can have such a huge impact on how we see our day to day lives.
    This can mean a difference of wondering why your doors are hard to open sometimes, and noticing 
    your wooden doors are harder to open when it's raining because the wood swells. Technical knowledge
    is just as crucial, especially in this day and age. Staying up to date with new technologies
    and knowing how to use them is now just as important as any other subject that can
    be taught in school. Lastly, I feel that one of the biggest things I get out
    of listening is being able to hear how others are interpreting the world around you. Listening
    helps give an additional level of perception that otherwise would be hard to understand, both
    conceptually and literally. Although these are probably not the most effective ways of developing
    a brain, I feel that they are key in how I develop mine.
