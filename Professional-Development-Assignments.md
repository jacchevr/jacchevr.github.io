# Professional Development Assignments

## Week 1

### <u>Quantative Accomplishments</u>
  + While working for a local stainless steel fabrication shop, I suggested the owner use a different supplier
  when it came to welding supplies.
  
      + This ultimately lead to thousands of dollars in savings yearly.
      
  + While working for a local filtration company, I found that their eCommerce platform could be updated to 
  add new information as well as improve search engine optimization (SEO).
      
      + The resulting sales from my changes nearly doubled their revenue from their online store.
      
  + During the summer that I was an intern at the permitting office for the City of Albuquerque,
  I implemented a simple sign in station that helped establish a first come first serve basis.
  
      + Before the sign in station, I found that a lot of contractors that frequented the office would 
      cut in front of other customers, causing some customers to be there much longer than was necessary.
      
  ### <u>Qualitative Features</u>
  
  + When working on a project that has multiples of the same part being made, I tend to create jigs to help 
  expedite the process.
  
      + I found that this not only helped speed up production, but it also lead to less frequent errors. 
      
  + I go out of my way to make sure that if I am part of a group, my team and I succeed as a whole.
  
      + I have found myself a few times in a position where success would be easily obtainable individually
      but have chosen to stay behind to help others that needed it.
